## ***Exploratory Data Analysis***
In total, this analysis included the following columns:
* Age
* Sex
* Children
* Smoker
* Charges

All of the previous values were used to determine the average hospital charge relative to each column. The results were similar to what one would expect.

* As age increases, cost goes up linearly
* Males are charges slightly more than females
* More children generally means higher charges
* Smoking drastically increases hospital charges

All of the said results have visualized graphs stores in the images directory.
