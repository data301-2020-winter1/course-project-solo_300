# Group 300 - Analysis of Medical Data

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

What I plan on doing with this dataset is observe how factors that are considered unhealthy such as abnormal BMI or smoking ciggarettes affect hospital charges and by how much. I will also determine what age and gender groups get charged more than others. I am interested in this topic because without universal healthcare some people get affected by treatment costs more than others, and I want to determine which groups stand out apart from the others. The questions I hope to answer are specifically "How much smoking affects healthcare costs" and "What is the treatment cost to BMI relation". This data would most likely be fairly easy to build a dataset with since it is standard medical statistics

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data set is from a public domain, with it's content including statistics on hospital charges. Along with their age and gender, the data has further information on the patients health. This data includes statistics such as their BMI, number of children, and if they are a smoker. This data was collected on 2018-02-20 by Miri Choi. The purpose of this dataset is to determine what information about a patient affects the total hospital charge the most. Knowing how much extra patients are charged based in factors such as their BMI, gender, and if they smoke or not constitutes as public interest. The source of this data could not be found on the internet, therefore the set is most likely generated by an algorithm in a language as VBA or R. Regardless of the fact that the data is randomly generated, the statistics will reflect the fact that hospitals will most likely charge more for patients with an unhealthy BMI or if they smoke.
